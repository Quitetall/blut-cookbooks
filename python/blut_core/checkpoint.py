"""checkpoint — corruption-safe torch checkpoint I/O + a resume payload contract
(ADR 0044 P7, "durability"; the single most important reliability gap).

- ``save(payload, path)`` — free-space preflight → write to a unique tmp in the
  same dir → ``fsync`` → atomic ``os.replace`` → write a sidecar ``<path>.sha256``.
  A mid-write kill leaves the PRIOR checkpoint intact, never a truncated file
  (the failure mode that silently corrupts on a disk-full ``torch.save``).
  Optional ``keep_last_n`` rotation of ``<stem>_ep*.pt`` siblings.
- ``load(path, validate=True)`` — verify the sidecar SHA (or, absent a sidecar,
  a dry ``torch.load`` of the bytes) BEFORE returning → a corrupt/truncated
  checkpoint raises ``CheckpointError``, never silent garbage.
- ``validate_payload(payload, required)`` — assert the resume contract keys are
  present so a resume fails fast at SAVE, not 3 epochs into a relaunch (prior
  bites: optimizer-state, QAT-alpha). Default contract = the training-resume set.

torch is lazy-imported (only on save/load), so importing ``blut_core`` stays cheap.
